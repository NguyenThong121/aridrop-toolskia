The best bugs hide in the smallest details.The first step in optimization is not to do it.First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.Code like you mean it.A true programmer never blames the compiler.Comment your code like you’ll never see it again.One does not simply write bug-free code.Try, catch, cry.Write code that even your grandma can understand.Code is read more often than it is written.First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."To-do" comments will never be done.Programming is 90% frustration, 10% eureka moments.Stack Overflow is my best friend.Software development is 90% Googling and 10% typing.When in doubt, refactor.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.The best debugging strategy is to assume you’re wrong.If it works, don’t touch it.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.Most coding problems can be solved by taking a break.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Commit messages should be as detailed as a tweet.Git happens.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.I’d rather be coding.terxtperoayad adadasd
